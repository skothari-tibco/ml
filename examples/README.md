Here are several examples of Flogo apps with ML included.

Here are several examples of Flogo apps with ML included.

1. [cnnUnitTest](ecnnUnitTest) -  using a CNN for where a maximum is in a gaussian - a basic ML model for a flogo app using the flogo library API
2. [cocoImageRecog](cocoImageRecog) - build an app that creates a REST API that does image recognition
3. [streamingOutlier](streamingOutlier) - simulates data streaming from multiple sources being joined and fed into a DNN outlier detector
4. [cobi_bike](cobi_bike) - an outlier detector (autoencoder) for [COBI bike](cobi.bike)
5. [flowsOutlier][flowsOutlier] - modifying the [streamingOutlier](streamingOutlier) to use [flows](https://github.com/project-flogo/flow)
